# Nobel Prize Data Analysis (1901–2023)

This project explores over a century of Nobel Prize awards through data analysis and visualisation. The focus is on using Python-based data tools to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from a structured dataset of Nobel laureates.

## 📊 Overview

We use a dataset of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023 to practise and demonstrate the following core data analysis techniques:

- Data cleaning and inspection
- Summary statistics (categorical and numerical)
- Handling missing values
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Creating derived columns (e.g. decades)
- Filtering and conditional logic
- Custom function application
- Data visualisation (line plots, bar plots)

Rather than focusing solely on the Nobel Prize as a topic, this project highlights the **analytical thinking and coding practices** used to extract value from a real-world dataset.

## 🔍 Key Questions Addressed

- What are the most frequently awarded gender and birth countries?
- Which decade had the highest proportion of US-born winners?
- When and in what category did women achieve the highest representation?
- Who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize?
- Which individuals or organisations have won multiple times?

---

## 🧪 Analysis Highlights

- Performed exploratory data analysis to examine category frequencies, laureate demographics, and organisational affiliations.
- Identified and quantified missing values across fields like birth dates, death locations, and organisational data.
- Created custom functions to calculate and compare ratios across decades (e.g. proportion of US-born winners).
- Visualised gender representation over time within different prize categories.
- Extracted notable statistics such as the most common birthplaces and institutions associated with laureates.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** for visualisation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration

## 📈 Sample Insights

- The United States dominates Nobel wins, especially from the mid-20th century onward.
- Female representation remains low overall but has improved in recent decades.
- A small number of individuals and organisations have received multiple Nobel Prizes.
